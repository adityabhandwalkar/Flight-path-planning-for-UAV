# Flight-path-planning-for-UAV
Special project
This project is related to the photogrammetry and computer vision. Here we are trying to form the optimized flight trajectory around the object which needs to be reconstructed. Note that mesh we are using is alredy provided so that optimized points along with their viewing direction is implemented. Platform: Jupyter notebook (Python 3.0) Libraries Used: Trimesh numpy scipy
